## 2026-06-24 — Implement in Go, not the spec's C

**Context:** `overview.md` specifies a C library (`ch_local_inspect`) using RE2, MuPDF, and miniz under CMake. This is a PoC whose goal is correctness + measurability of a resource budget, with fast iteration valued.

**Decision:** Build the PoC in **Go 1.26**, keeping every concept and the public behaviour of the spec (rule reuse, compatibility classification, ALLOW/BLOCK/ESCALATE verdicts keyed to `dataset_id`, the budget). Diverge from the spec's C-level API surface.

**Why this is sound, not a shortcut:**
- Go's standard-library `regexp` **is an RE2 implementation** — the spec's central RE2 compatibility model is native, with no cgo. `regexp.Compile` succeeding/failing *is* the LOCAL_CAPABLE vs CLOUD_ONLY test.
- OOXML extraction (DOCX/XLSX/PPTX) is `archive/zip` + `encoding/xml` in stdlib — no miniz needed.
- Single static binary; trivial cross-compile to macOS/Linux; fast iteration.

**Alternatives considered:**
- *C as specified* — max fidelity and closest to the production sensor, but heavy deps (RE2/MuPDF submodules) and slow iteration for a PoC.
- *Hybrid (Go prototype → port to C)* — viable later if footprint demands it.

**Consequences:**
- PDF text extraction has no MuPDF; v2 uses a Go PDF text library (e.g. `ledongthuc/pdf`) or defers PDF.
- GC and binary size must be watched against the ≤50 MB / ≤3% CPU budget via benchmarks.
- If the validated design must ship in the native sensor, port the proven approach to C/Rust later.

## 2026-06-24 — Rule reuse is the architecture (per spec §2)

**Context:** Maintaining separate cloud and local rule sets would diverge and cause unexplainable detection discrepancies.

**Decision:** Consume the cloud-side rules file as **read-only** input. `dataset_id`/`rule_id` pass through unmodified to verdicts; every match is tagged `scan_path: "local"`. Never silently drop a rule — `CLOUD_ONLY` rules always surface in the compatibility report with a specific reason.

**Consequences:** Local and cloud verdicts on identical content are directly comparable; rewrite-induced semantic drift is detectable. The compiler, not a hand-written detector set, is the heart of the system.

## 2026-06-24 — Build order: thin vertical slice first

**Context:** Heavy formats (PDF) add dependency weight before any measurable result.

**Decision:** v0 = plaintext/CSV end-to-end (load rules + compat report + scan + validators + verdict + consistency test + latency benchmark). v1 = OOXML (archive/zip). v2 = PDF text layer + full label paths.

**Consequences:** Fastest path to a measurable, comparable result that proves the rule-reuse architecture before investing in format breadth.

## 2026-06-24 — Size gate + head/tail extraction

**Context:** A multi-MB/GB file shouldn't be fully inspected inline on the endpoint hot path (spec §4.3).

**Decision:** `extract.Config` gains `MaxFileBytes` (gate, default 16 MB; CLI `--max-file-mb`) and `HeadTailWindow` (default 64 KB). Over the gate, only the head + tail windows are inspected and the result is flagged `Partial` (plaintext gated on raw bytes to avoid building a huge string). The verdict is **coverage-aware**: a `Partial`/`Truncated` result that is otherwise clean → **ESCALATE**, not ALLOW (the unseen middle must not be silently passed). Profiles/labels firing in the head/tail still BLOCK; the metadata label path always runs on the full container (docProps are tiny).

**Consequences:** cost is bounded regardless of file size (21 MB file → 131 KB inspected, ~18 ms). The trade-off is the middle of very large files isn't scanned locally — surfaced as ESCALATE for cloud/heavier inspection, exactly the intended hand-off.

## 2026-06-24 — OOXML sensitivity-label fast-path

**Context:** Sensitivity labels (MS MIP/AIP, custom org markings) are a high-value, cheap signal that doesn't need full content inspection (spec §4.5).

**Decision:** `internal/label` with two paths, driven by a `label_markers` section in rules.json:
- **Metadata fast-path** — open the OOXML zip and read *only* `docProps/custom.xml`+`core.xml`; match property names against `metadata_properties` (MSIP_Label/Sensitivity/Classification/DataClass) and values against label strings. Runs on raw bytes in `InspectFile` before/around extraction. Machine-written ⇒ authoritative ⇒ upgrades verdict to **BLOCK**.
- **Body fallback** — scan extracted text for *distinctive* markings only (multi-word or all-caps, case-sensitive) so "Confidential" in prose doesn't trip it ⇒ at least **ESCALATE**.

Verdict gains `labels[]` (with `source`). Disposition uses a severity upgrade (BLOCK>ESCALATE>ALLOW) so labels combine cleanly with profile verdicts.

**Consequences:** a labelled-but-otherwise-clean document is now caught (metadata→BLOCK) with negligible cost (no body scan needed). Body markings are deliberately conservative to limit FPs.

**2026-06-24 update — PDF XMP:** extended the metadata fast-path to PDF. We locate the XMP packet (`<?xpacket…?>`) in the raw bytes and match property names (with separator/case normalisation, so `msip:Label` matches the `MSIP_Label` cue) + label-string values. The fast-path now runs in `InspectFile` even when text extraction *fails*, so a labelled-but-unparseable PDF still BLOCKs (was previously a plain ESCALATE). Limitation: compressed XMP metadata streams aren't decoded (MSIP/AIP keep XMP uncompressed in practice).

## 2026-06-24 — Tier-2 detectors + early-exit short-circuit

**Context:** Broaden coverage (US+UK Tier-2) and let the engine stop once a verdict is decided.

**Decision — Tier-2 detectors:** added `us_itin` (validator `itin_check`), `us_drivers_license` (best-effort, keyword-gated), `us_medicare_mbi` (HIPAA health), `uk_drivers_license`. Added a **UK_PII profile** mirroring US_PII — this also activates the already-present `uk_nino`/`uk_passport`/`uk_utr`, which previously fed no profile. Now 31 detectors, 6 profiles, still all LOCAL_CAPABLE.

**Decision — early-exit:** evaluate detectors in priority-ordered batches (validator-backed/strong first); after each batch re-evaluate profiles and stop once a BLOCK-confidence verdict is reached, or once `max_total_matches` is crossed. The disposition can't change after BLOCK, so remaining detectors are pure cost (allocs dropped ~65× on saturated input).

**Consequences:** a short-circuited verdict is **disposition-correct but may list a partial set of profiles** (we stopped once it was clearly bad — the requested behaviour). Detection-completeness tests therefore run with early-exit disabled; the fast path is asserted separately (`TestEarlyExit`). `us_drivers_license`'s generic shape is FP-prone → kept best-effort + keyword-gated + low confidence.

## 2026-06-24 — Multi-pattern matcher to hit the 500KB latency budget

**Context:** Naive per-detector scanning ran ~2.8 MB/s → a 500 KB file took ~185 ms, ~1.8× over the <100 ms target.

**Decision:** Four layered, semantics-preserving optimisations (see docs/engine-notes.md):
1. **Aho-Corasick literal prefilter** (`internal/prefilter`) — one pass marks which literal cues are present; literal-anchored detectors with no cue are skipped. Plus a `needs_digit` gate.
2. **Match cap (64)** — `FindAllStringIndex` stops early; we never need all matches to satisfy a profile.
3. **Parallel detector scan** — independent read-only detectors run across `NumCPU` goroutines.
4. (kept) best-effort keyword gating + per-detector pattern combine.

Result: ~17 MB/s. 500 KB dense ~31 ms, 500 KB prose+PII ~33 ms, typical ≤8 KB ~0.7 ms — all within budget. Race-clean.

**Rejected:** a single mega-regex (all detectors in one alternation) — overlapping detectors steal each other's matches (ABA's `\d{9}` ate NPI digits → HIPAA stopped firing) and it was slower. RE2 set-matching gives membership, not all per-pattern positions.

**Consequences:** counts saturate at the cap (fine for our thresholds); parallelism trades a brief CPU burst for latency (the ≤3% CPU budget is amortised over an event stream); a true vectorised matcher (Hyperscan) remains the production path for pathological inputs.

## 2026-06-24 — Extraction: stdlib for OOXML, ledongthuc/pdf for PDF

**Context:** The engine needs to inspect real documents (DOCX/XLSX/PPTX/PDF), not just plaintext. The spec's C design used miniz + MuPDF.

**Decision:** OOXML via the Go standard library (`archive/zip` + a tag-stripping pass over the text-bearing parts) — no third-party dep. PDF text layer via `github.com/ledongthuc/pdf` (pure Go, MIT) — the one external dependency, chosen over cgo/MuPDF to keep the PoC a single static binary.

**Consequences:**
- OOXML extraction is dependency-free and fast.
- PDF text extraction covers standard text-layer PDFs; it won't handle scanned/OCR, complex CMaps, or encrypted PDFs — those degrade to ESCALATE. `ledongthuc/pdf` can panic on malformed input, so the extractor wraps it in a recover and fails to ESCALATE, never crashing.
- Encrypted/legacy OLE files (`D0 CF 11 E0`) are detected and ESCALATEd, not parsed (spec scope excludes them).

## 2026-06-24 — Open: negative-lookahead PII patterns

**Context:** The spec's sample SSN pattern uses negative lookaheads `(?!000|666|9\d{2})`, which strict RE2 (and Go `regexp`) reject.

**Decision (provisional):** Classify such patterns `CLOUD_ONLY` by default. Revisit a semantic range-rewrite to `LOCAL_APPROXIMATE` once the **real** rules file is available and we know how prevalent lookaheads are.

**Consequences:** Initial local coverage may exclude some structured-PII rules; the compatibility report will make the gap explicit and quantified.
